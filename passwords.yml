Matterhorn is a service based module platform using the OSGi standard [1] to implement service orientation. Each of the services have different requirements regarding CPU, I/O and memory resources, which indicates that different services should be running on different processing platforms provisioned to the service’s requirements. Ideally, the pilot system features at least one instance of each type.
Administration
The administration instance is - next to offering the administrative user interfaces - in charge of dispatching the work defined as part of the processing workflows to the respective services.
Worker
The worker instance hosts most of the processing and I/O intensive services such as encoding, media analysis and ingest. With an increase in number of parallel recordings there needs to be an increased ingest, processing and distribution capacity in order to be able to guarantee service level agreements. The number of jobs handled in parallel by a worker node is proportional to the number of cores, so adding more cores per worker will reduce the need for worker instances.
Presentation
The presentation server is hosting the Matterhorn Engage user interface as well as RSS and Atom feeds that allow visitors to browse and access the recorded content. It needs to be accessible to external visitors.
Delivery
While the presentation server provides access to the recording’s metadata and allows for browsing and consumption of the recordings, the delivery platform is in charge of actually serving the media either through download or streaming servers. Matterhorn comes with simple downloads only file serving capabilities, but the use of enterprise level download and streaming services is highly recommended for both performance and security reasons.
